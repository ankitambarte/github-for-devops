flake8 - used to check the quality of python code or it can check the errors in programming

example - flake8 file_name.extension

we can use this before commiting the code to get best quality code
 we can use hooks to do this 

Create a file in hooks
put shell script in it 

files = $(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep'\.py$')
flake8 $files

give executable permissions to this file by
chmod 777

do try adding a .py file and test this results
